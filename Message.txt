üèè Excited to share my latest project: CricVision AI - Advanced Cricket Analytics Dashboard! üöÄ

CricVision AI is an intelligent cricket analytics platform that leverages machine learning to provide real-time match predictions and comprehensive player insights. The dashboard predicts wicket probability, expected runs per ball, and boundary likelihood using three trained ML models with StandardScaler normalization. It features interactive match scenarios (Powerplay, Middle, and Death overs), over-by-over projections, win probability calculations, and economy rate forecasts. Users can compare players head-to-head, analyze form trends over recent innings, visualize run distribution through wagon wheels, and get AI confidence scores for all predictions - making it a complete solution for cricket enthusiasts and analysts.

This project demonstrates how AI can revolutionize sports analytics by turning raw match data into actionable insights in real-time. Whether you're a cricket coach planning strategies, a fantasy league player making informed decisions, or simply a data-driven fan, CricVision AI provides the competitive edge. Built with a modern tech stack including Python, Dash & Plotly for interactive visualizations, Scikit-learn for ML model training and predictions, Pandas & NumPy for data processing, and Pickle for model serialization, this dashboard showcases the power of combining data science with intuitive UI/UX design. The premium dark theme interface with gradient cards and responsive charts makes complex analytics accessible to everyone! üìä‚ú®
